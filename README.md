## 💡 Why I made this?

My ISP won't let me open some ports on my router so I can't use SSH to connect to my server.  
I created this bot to run shell commands on my server remotely through Discord.

I can also use it to run commands on my local machine.

> ~**Modern problems require modern solutions**

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/igorkowalczyk/discord-ssh.git`
2. Install dependencies `pnpm install` or `npm install`
3. Create `.env` file in the root directory
4. Copy the content from [`.env` config](#-env-config)
5. Fill the `.env` file with your data
6. Run the bot `pnpm run start` or `npm run start` (or `pnpm run dev` or `npm run dev` for development)
7. Invite the bot to your server (see [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
8. Send command in channel which you set in `.env` file
9. Wait for the response, that's it!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You have to enable `Message Content` intent in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to use this bot!

> [!NOTE]
> Bot will not respond to messages in other channels or other members than you (bot owner) unless you change it in the `.env` file or in the code

## 🔩 Limitations

- `sudo` / `su`commands are not supported, and probably never will be (for security reasons).
- Text inputs are not supported (e.g. `nano`), but you can use `echo` to create/edit files.
- Colored output is not supported and can be broken!

> [!NOTE]
> Changing directory (`cd`) is supported when it's at the beginning of a command!

## 🔐 `.env` config

```sh
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values.

CHANNEL_ID="Discord channel ID"
OWNERS_IDS="ID 1,ID 2,ID 3"
TOKEN="Discord bot token"
CUSTOM_CWD="Default path to the bot's working directory (optional - remove this line if you don't need it)"

```
