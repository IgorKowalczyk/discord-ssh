## üí° Why I made this?

My ISP won't let me open some ports on my router so I can't use SSH to connect to my server.  
I created this bot to run shell commands on my server remotely through Discord.

I can also use it to run commands on my local machine.

> ~**Modern problems require modern solutions**

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/igorkowalczyk/discord-ssh.git`)
2. Install dependencies (`npm install` / `pnpm install`)
3. Create `.env` file and fill it with your data (see [`.env` config](#-env-config))
4. Run the bot (`npm run start` / `pnpm run start`)
5. Invite the bot to your server
6. Send command in channel which you set in `.env` file
7. Wait for the response, that's it!

> [!NOTE]
> You have to enable `Message Content` intent in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to use this bot!  
> Bot will not respond to messages in other channels or other members than you (bot owner)

## üî¶ How to use

- Go to channel where you want to run commands _(you can change it in `.env`)_
- Type your command and wait for the response _(it may take a while)_

- `sudo` commands are not supported
- Text inputs are not supported (e.g. `nano`)
- `cd` command is partially supported (you can change default directory in `.env`)
- Colored output is not supported and can be broken

> [!NOTE]
